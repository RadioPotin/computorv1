(*
  - 2nd degree polynome:

    ax² + bx + c

  - Formula to find the delta of the equation and find nb of solutions:

    \delta = b² - 4ac

      if (\delta < 0) then
         solution found with imaginary numbers
      else if (\delta = 0) then
         one solution possible
      else if (\delta > 0) then
         2 possible solutions.

  - Solving for x:

    bx + c = 0
    bx = -c
    x = (-c)/b
